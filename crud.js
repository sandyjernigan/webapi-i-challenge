// Stretch Problems

// To work on the stretch problems you'll need to enable the cors middleware. Follow these steps:

//     add the cors npm module: yarn add cors or npm i cors.
//     add server.use(cors()) after server.use(express.json()).

// Create a new React application and connect it to your server:

//     the React application can be anywhere, but, for this project create it inside the folder for the solution.
//     connect to the /api/users endpoint in the API and show the list of users.
//     add a delete button to each displayed user that will remove it from the server.
//     add forms to add and update data.
//     Style the list of users however you see fit.
